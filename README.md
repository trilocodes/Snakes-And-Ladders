====================== ENJOY! =================

"Snakes and Ladders" is a classic board game enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. 
It's a game of chance that involves rolling dice and moving tokens across a numbered grid. 
The game is known by different names in different regions, such as "Chutes and Ladders" in some parts of the world.

The game typically consists of a square grid with a series of numbered squares, often arranged in a 10x10 format, although the size can vary.
The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach the final square, usually numbered 100, 
by moving their token from square to square according to the outcome of dice rolls.

The distinctive feature of Snakes and Ladders are the "snakes" and "ladders" that connect certain squares on the grid. 
Ladders allow players to advance quickly by climbing up to a higher-numbered square, while snakes force players to slide down to a lower-numbered square, 
setting them back in their progress.

The game is purely based on luck, as players have no control over the outcome of their dice rolls. 
This makes it a simple and entertaining game suitable for players of all ages. 
Snakes and Ladders is often used as a tool for teaching young children basic counting skills and the concept of cause and effect, 
as well as for recreational purposes among friends and family.
